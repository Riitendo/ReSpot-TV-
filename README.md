# ReSpot TV 3DS
ReSpot TV 3DS is a project made to translate (and revive in the future) SpotPass TV, a japanese exclusive app, which ressembles Nintendo Video.

This project has the goal of being at least a working template to import custom videos in it. For now, only translations are available.
Patches are available in French, English, Spanish, Italian and German.
